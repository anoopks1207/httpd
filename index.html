<p>Are you torn between the major container orchestration tools out there? We compare Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Amazon ECS to see which one comes out on top.</p>
<h1>Container Orchestration: A Quick Introduction</h1>
<p>Primitive container technology has been around since the late 1970s but didn’t become prominent until Docker debuted in 2013. From that point, containers have exploded in popularity; dramatically changing the DevOps landscape and the way we build, ship, and run distributed applications. It’s no coincidence then that Docker’s growth and container usage are developing in synchrony.</p>
<p>However, running a single container is like a lone musical instrument playing its symphonic score in isolation. Container orchestration allows you, the conductor, to unify the orchestra by managing and shaping the sound of the whole ensemble.</p>
<p>Container orchestration tools offer useful and powerful solutions for creating, managing, and updating multiple containers in coordination across multiple hosts. On top of that, orchestration allows you to share data between your services and process tasks asynchronously. Within your production environment, you can run multiple instances of each service over multiple servers to make an application highly available. The more we simplify orchestration, the deeper we can dive into the application and break down smaller microservices.</p>
<p>Which raises the question, which tool do you pick to conduct your symphony?</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll be comparing the three major players in container orchestration to help you choose the right one for you.</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Container orchestration relies heavily on your infrastructure, meaning it is important to look at how these solutions integrate with your current cloud provider/on-premise solution. Are you willing to buy into one cloud provider’s entire toolchain? Or do you need something more agnostic?</p>
<p>Kubernetes is emerging as the current leader in the container orchestration space, surpassing Docker Swarm thanks to its configurability, reliability, and large community. Created by Google as an open-source project, Kubernetes works harmoniously with the whole Google Cloud Platform. Plus, it runs well on almost any infrastructure.</p>
<p>Swarm is Docker’s own orchestration tool which is now fully integrated with Docker Engine and makes use of the standard API and networking. Built into the Docker CLI, Swarm Mode requires no additional installation and new Swarm commands are easy to pick up. Deploying a service can be as simple as using the ‘docker service create’ command. Docker Swarm is fighting back against Kubernetes for the lead in the popularity race by making strides in performance, flexibility, and simplicity to gain renewed adoption.</p>
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is Amazon’s proprietary container scheduler and designed to work in harmony with other AWS services. This means that AWS centric solutions like monitoring, load balancing, and storage integrate easily into your service. If you are using an alternative cloud provider to Amazon—or if you are running your workload on-premise—then ECS is probably not a fit.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Developed from 15 years of working with Linux containers, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a> (abbreviated to K8s or Kube) is Google’s open-source answer to container management. It works in multiple production environments including bare metal, on-premise VMs, on most cloud providers, plus combinations/hybrids of all three.</p>
<p>Clusters include several major components:</p>
